# Review: Stackbit Beta

2020-07-30

## What is Stackbit?

Stackbit is a website design and deployment tool with an online What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) interface for modern web tools. While sites like WordPress and Squarespace offer similar-looking services and design tools, Stackbit is aimed more towards tech-savvy individuals who want to get their feet wet in web development or want to push a product out quickly. Most impressively, Stackbit has integration with tools like Gatsby and Netlify to allow for easy design using the React framework for deployment. Stackbit also integrates well with a variety of version control tools--Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket--just to name a few, resulting in a smooth workflow between their WYSIWYG editor and any local development environments. Better yet, deployment is automatic upon updating the source repository, so changes can be seen immediately after merging new changes.

However, here are some things that Stackbit currently is not:

- A drag-and-drop HTML/CSS editor
- An automated back-end generator

## The Good

Stackbit has three main advantages over it's competitors right now:

- It is completely free to use while in beta, so you can try it out and deploy your websites for nothing.
- Fast and efficient modern frameworks like React or Jekyll can be automatically integrated.
- Cloud-based automated deployment through Netlify allows for speed and cost efficiency, so I anticipate that Stackbit will have an edge both performance-wise and price-wise when the official release comes out.

These features aside, my favorite aspect of Stackbit is the ability to integrate Markdown with a React-based web app without any overhead on the developer's end. This makes it optimal for blogging with Markdown files as posts. The WYSIWYG editor is also definitely meant to cater towards Markdown users as well, but it also has graphical indicators for those unfamiliar with Markdown syntax.

## The Bad

Since it is currently still in beta, it would be unfair to expect Stackbit to be completely flushed out as a finished product with full-fledged features. However, these flaws are worth pointing out, and the Stackbit team has been very open to constructive feedback in their beta program. As of right now, you can easily fill out a Google form on the Stackbit site to apply for free Pro features that will last until the official release, and it gives you the change to enter feedback and feature suggestions. Currently, the features that I find lacking are:

- **Full git workflow integration:** It is currently possible to edit locally and deploy, but doing so can cause the Stackbit WYSIWYG editor to lag behind the master branch of your repository. This means you will be unable to use the online editor until you merge the changes into the branch manually. It would definitely be more convenient to offer an easy option to pull changes automatically via a button or through automated detection.
- **More official templates:** Stackbit only features a handful of templates which are aimed towards blogs and e-commerce. While I do think the existing templates are great, the selection definitely pales in comparison with competitors. Developers can make their own themes for Stackbit, however, so I expect the number to gradually grow. However in its current state, there are relatively few options for those who don't want to code their own themes.
- **More options:** Similarly, Stackbit is somewhat lacking in customizability after you choose a template. There is very little control over the color scheme and page layout. Oftentimes I find myself looking for an option, like inserting an image in the hero section of a page, but the predetermined template styles do not offer any options to do so in the online editor. And while Stackbit does support Font Awesome icons, it does even currently support all of the free-tier icons, or if it does, it limits templates to certain icons.

## Conclusion

While Stackbit currently has its flaws, it is still in beta, so we have a lot to look forward to. I personally see great potential in the platform, especially since it seems to be offering a niche solution for more tech-savvy individuals to quickly deploy websites using modern frameworks. I can see many React developers using this tool to expedite their workflows, especially if Stackbit continues to add more options for templating and customization.
